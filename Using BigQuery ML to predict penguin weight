Using BigQuery ML to predict penguin weight


This tutorial introduces data analysts to BigQuery ML. BigQuery ML enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using SQL queries.
The goal is to democratize machine learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build models using their existing tools and to increase development speed by eliminating the need for data movement.

In this tutorial, you use the penguin table to create a model that predicts the weight of a penguin based on the penguin's species, island of residence, culmen length and depth, flipper length, and sex.
