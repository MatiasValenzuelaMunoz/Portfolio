Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



                                                      Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding



1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =      key id 10000 records
ii. Hours =        foreign key business_id 1562 records
iii. Category =    foreign key business_id 2643 records
iv. Attribute =    foreign key business_id 1115 records
v. Review = 	   key id 10000, foreign key business_id 8090 records, foreign key user_id 9581 records
vi. Checkin = 	   foreign key business_id 493 records
vii. Photo = 	   key id 10000, foreign key business_id 6493 records
viii. Tip = 	   foreign key business_id 3979 records, foreign key user_id 537 records
ix. User = 	   key id 10000 records
x. Friend = 	   foreign key 11 records
xi. Elite_years =  foreign key user_id 2780 records

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
	open has more stars rating than close
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
         open has more reviews than close
         
SQL code used for analysis:

select 
is_open,
b.stars,
b.review_count
from business b inner join category c

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
	the more success category and bussiness rating by sentiment reviews
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
             this dataset compiles business category and displays the user opinions ratings by numerical rating of reviews , stars, and othes sentiments like usefull coll and funny for each category...can be usefull to search the succesfull categories and see the ratio of sentiments that customers have from.              
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+---------------------------+----------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-----------+------------+
